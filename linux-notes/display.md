## Disable Wayland on Ubuntu

- Follow this guide |Â [How to enable/disable wayland on Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-enable-disable-wayland-on-ubuntu-22-04-desktop)
- Wayland caused me problems with TeamViewer and keyboard input. Keyboard input was freezing every few seconds (both wireless Logitech keyboard and on-screen keyboard).
- There is supposed to be a gear in the bottom right corner of Ubuntu login screen to switch between Wayland and Xorg, but my install doesn't have that. I don't know why.
