Prompt = "I learned C++ in 2011. What are all the changes that have been added since then?"

1. **C++11 (2011)**:
    - **Lambda Expressions**: Allow you to define anonymous functions.
    - **Range-based For Loop**: Simplifies iterating over containers.
    - **Auto Keyword**: Enables type inference for variable declarations.
    - **Smart Pointers**: `std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` for improved memory management.
    - **Move Semantics**: Introduces move constructors and move assignment operators for efficient resource management.
    - **Rvalue References**: Allows you to distinguish between lvalues and rvalues.
    - **Concurrency**: Standardizes support for multithreading with features like `std::thread` and `std::mutex`.
    - **Standard Library Enhancements**: Including new containers like `std::array`, regular expressions support, and more.
2. **C++14 (2014)**:
    
    - **Generic Lambdas**: Lambdas with auto parameters.
    - **Return Type Deduction**: The compiler can deduce the return type of functions.
    - **Binary Literals and Digit Separators**: Enhances readability.
    - **Variable Templates**: Templates for variables, not just functions or classes.
    - **std::make_unique**: Complements `std::make_shared`.
3. **C++17 (2017)**:
    
    - **Structured Bindings**: Easier decomposition of objects.
    - **std::optional**: Represents optional values.
    - **std::variant**: Represents a type-safe union.
    - **Parallel Algorithms**: Standard library support for parallelism.
    - **Filesystem Library**: std::filesystem for filesystem operations.
    - **if constexpr**: Compile-time conditional statements.
    - **Fold Expressions**: Simplifies variadic template code.
4. **C++20 (2020)**:
    
    - **Concepts**: Introduces concepts for template type constraints.
    - **Ranges**: Range-based algorithms and views.
    - **Coroutines**: Support for asynchronous code.
    - **Three-Way Comparisons**: Simplifies operator overloads.
    - **Modules**: Replaces traditional header files with modules.
    - **Improved Standard Library**: Including new features in various library components.
5. **C++23 (Expected)**:
    
    - **Proposals Under Consideration**: Concepts will be further integrated. Likely additions include numeric formatting, more library enhancements, and more.
