In JavaScript, there are several ways to define functions. Here are the main methods:

1. **Function Declaration:**
    - This is the most common way to define a function. It involves using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

	```js
	function add(a, b) {
		return a + b;
	}
	```

	- Function declarations are hoisted, meaning you can use them before they are declared in the code.
1. **Function Expression:**
    - In a function expression, a function is assigned to a variable. This can be done using the `function` keyword or, more commonly, using the arrow function syntax.

    ```js
	// Using function keyword
	const multiply = function(a, b) {
		return a * b;
	};
	
	// Using arrow function
	const divide = (a, b) => {
		return a / b;
	};
    ```

    - Function expressions are not hoisted like function declarations.
3. **Arrow Functions:**
    - Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax, especially for small anonymous functions.

	```js
	const square = (x) => x * x;
	```

    - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value; they inherit it from the surrounding scope.
4. **Function Constructor:**
    - You can create a function using the `Function` constructor. This is less common and not recommended due to security risks (it can execute arbitrary code passed as a string).

	```js
	const greet = new Function('name', 'console.log("Hello, " + name);');
	
	greet('John');
	```

    - Using the `Function` constructor is discouraged because of security implications and the potential for injection attacks.
1. **Generator Functions:**
    - Generator functions are special kinds of functions that can be paused and resumed.

	```js
	function* generateSequence() {
		yield 1;
		yield 2;
		yield 3;
	}
	
	const generator = generateSequence();
	
	console.log(generator.next().value); // 1
	console.log(generator.next().value); // 2
	```

    - Generators are denoted by the `function*` syntax.

These are the main ways to define functions in JavaScript. Each has its use case, and the choice often depends on factors like readability, scoping requirements, and the need for certain features (like arrow functions for concise syntax or generator functions for asynchronous programming).
