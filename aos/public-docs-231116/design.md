# Design of AOS

A 1-hour long introduction to AOS, from August 2020, can be found
[here][youtube]; the corresponding
presentation is available
[here][slidedeck].

The information in that presentation is still essentially correct, with the main
changes since 2020 having been improvements to general stability and increased
feature support for things outside of the core functionality discussed there.
