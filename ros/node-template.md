# Node Template

From ChatGPT

```cpp
#include <ros/ros.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	// Initialize the ROS node
	ros::init(argc, argv, "my_node");
	
	// Create a ROS node handle
	ros::NodeHandle nh;
	
	// Add your code here
	
	// Main loop
	while (ros::ok())
	{
	// Add your code here
	
	// Handle ROS callbacks
	ros::spinOnce();
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```

In this template:

- `ros::init()` initializes the ROS node with the given name.
- `ros::NodeHandle` is used to create a handle for interacting with the ROS system.
- You can add your code and functionality where indicated by the comments.
- The main loop `while (ros::ok())` allows the node to continuously run until ROS is shut down.
- `ros::spinOnce()` allows the ROS system to handle any pending callbacks.

Remember to replace "my_node" with the desired name for your ROS node. You can add your own publishers, subscribers, services, and other functionality within the main loop and the indicated code sections.

Make sure to link against the necessary ROS libraries when compiling your node. For example, if you are using `catkin` build system, you can include the necessary dependencies in your `CMakeLists.txt` file.
