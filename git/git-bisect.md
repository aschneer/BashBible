# Git Bisect Guide

ChatGPT 3.5.

Here's a step-by-step guide with the commands to perform the process of bisecting using `git bisect`:

1. **Start Bisecting**:
   - Specify the known "good" commit:
     ```
     git bisect start
     git bisect good <good_commit>
     ```
   - Specify the known "bad" commit (or `HEAD` if the bug is present in the latest commit):
     ```
     git bisect bad <bad_commit>
     ```
   Git will now check out a commit roughly halfway between the "good" and "bad" commits.

2. **Test**:
   - Test whether the bug is present in the current commit.
   - If the bug is present, mark the current commit as "bad":
     ```
     git bisect bad
     ```
   - If the bug is not present, mark the current commit as "good":
     ```
     git bisect good
     ```
   Git will then narrow down the search space and check out the next commit for testing.

3. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat the testing and marking process (steps 2) until Git identifies the commit that introduced the bug.
   - Git will automatically narrow down the search space by selecting commits between the "good" and "bad" commits.

4. **Finish Bisecting**:
   - Once Git identifies the specific commit that introduced the bug, it will output the commit hash.
   - You can then inspect the identified commit to understand what changes caused the bug.
   - To end the bisecting process and return to the original state, use:
     ```
     git bisect reset
     ```

These commands will guide you through the process of bisecting with `git bisect`, allowing you to efficiently identify the commit that introduced a bug in your codebase.
